    A small footprint and configurable JESD204B core

[> Features
-----------
PHY:
 - PRBS7/PRBS15/PRBS31 to check link integrity.
 - 8B/10B encoding
 - 32 bits interface
 - Kintex7 support (CPLL up to 5Gbps, QPLL for higher linerates)
Core:
 Link:
  - Scrambling to reduce EMI
  - Special characters insertion
  - CGS/ILAS
 Transport:
  - converters <--> lanes mapping

[> Possible improvements
------------------------
- add support for RX (ADC)
- add support for non scrambled mode
- add support for Altera PHYs
- add support for Lattice PHYs
- add support for Xilinx 7-Series/Ultrascale GTP/GTH (currently only 7-Series
  GTX are supported)

[> Tests
--------
Unit tests are available in ./test/.
To run all the unit tests:
  setup.py test
Tests can also be run individually:
  python3 -m unittest test.test_name
